Hey Folks,

I've been working alot on Makersrocket.com, although it's mostly been interviews! I've never gotten to actually write. I want to change that, so I'm starting to write myself. I want to talk about the story of makers rocket, how I started the project, and the promblems I faced while buidling it. Belive me, it wasn't easy! It was hosnrly very annyoing.

When I first started the idea, I created a newsleter
